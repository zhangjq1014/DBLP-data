Firstly, after downling the DBLP XML file, please run parse.py. 
It will extract the publications from the conferences in CCF ranking. And it will output the results to a file proceedings.csv.


Then the All_authors folder contains 4 different analysis of the co-author networks.
1. Conf_degree   -> Average degree of the networks
2. Conf_giant    -> The size of the giant component of the conferences in 2020.
3. Conf_newauthors -> The ratio of the papers from newauthors, temporally analyzed until 2020.
4. Conf_giant_with_time   -> Average size of GC of different conference levels by time.

Each folder contains a .py file, it generates a figure and .txt file to store the results.


And Chair_metrics contains the computation of 3 chair relevant metrices.
1. Neighbour_acceptance   -> Pcap
2. Neighbour_gc           -> Ipaper-community
3. Neighbour_score        -> RDpaper-chair
