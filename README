This project is used to analyze the co-author networks of computer science conferences, incluing PC chairs information.

There are mainly 3 sets of data:
1. CCF_ranking of CS conferences  -> conferences_ccf.csv
2. PC chairs information         -> programs_chairs.csv
3. DBLP data                     -> dblp-2021-01-02.xml (other versions could be download via https://dblp.org/xml/release/)


For detailed information please go to DBLP-20 directory.
